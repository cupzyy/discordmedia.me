**Discordmedia.me** is a website that allows users to upload videos and generate a link that can be shared on Discord with full embed support. It uploads the file to FileDitch and generates urls with a unique id that makes the video viewable on Discord.

Unfortunately, FileDitch stopped supporting direct links (for good reasons), and this project was completely dependent on using FileDitch, so this is now closed down.

## Features
- Upload videos quickly and easily.
- Generates links that work seamlessly with Discord embeds.
- No compression or loss of quality.
- User-friendly and easy to navigate.

## How to Use
1. Visit [Discordmedia.me](https://discordmedia.me).
2. Upload the video you want to share.
3. Copy the generated link.
4. Share the link on Discord and enjoy full embed support!
